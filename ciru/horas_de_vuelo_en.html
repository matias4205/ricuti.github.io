        </strong>
I   have always told my students that learning science is like learning how   to become a pilot. You can't get to be a good one without having   completed the minimum flight training hours. This means that although   you can know all about theories... it's just not enough: you need to   practice in an even and regular way. It's precisely because of this   steady and intense practice that theory gets its <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em>.   Flight training hours are directly comparable to the ones needed for a   proper training in mathematics, physics, chemistry or whatever formal or   natural science where practice is basic. It's not at all enough to find   the right answer to<em> just one</em> question: you have to be able to   successfully and timely solve several, complete sets of similar or   identical problems, sometimes dealing with a shared quality, sometimes   managing to overcome subtle tricks, again and again... thus learning by   repetition. Through hard work and dogged perseverance   you'll certainly have improved your skills enough as to successively   gain your pilot's license first for the two-seater, then for the Cessna,   next for the jet, last for the domestic flights, and finally for the   international ones.<br>
<br>
In most cases, students end up learning (after some attempts doomed   to failure) that flight hours are completely neccesary to pass an exam.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, there is still a key issue they should be made aware of: as a general international rule, no pilot is allowed to operate the controls of an aircraft   if they have not previously completed the minimum required hours of   rest, relaxation and sleep. But this has nothing to do with their   suitability for the job. In other words, although there's no doubt about   their credibility as well-trained pilots, it's widely known that   getting enough time for rest and relaxation help reduce the probability of failure and accidents due to human error.<br>
<br>
Same thing happens when studying. Usually students take the whole   time just before the exam as a lifesaver that will help them gain   last-minute knowledge, quickly improve their skills and score victory.   Sadly, they are at the same time reducing precious hours that should be   taken for restful sleep. They should be strongly advised against sitting   for a test  in a poor mental, emotional, or physical condition that most likely will spoil their score.<br>
<br>
When I was a student (the truth is I'm still one of them), I used to   hang out with my classmates on the day just before the exam in order to   "talk the subject", that is, to discuss core topics that would   certainly be tested: just chatting openly, no agenda, no questions to   solve, no theory to go through. Meetings of this kind turn out to be   very productive as they help promote an open exchange of ideas and information in a friendly, relaxed way. This is the time when messed knowledge can at last be catalyzed, sorted out, synthesized, cleared up, crumbled and thoroughly analyzed.<br>
<br>
Just after sharing that pleasant time with peers, sleep comes on   stage to play a major role in helping students succeed. Getting no sleep   is like getting a ticket to crash and burn. It's because a restful sleep has the   same beneficial effects on their minds as those of the "informal talk" meeting: the rough draft happens to be edited, things fall into place, pieces start to fit neatly into the jigsaw and in the end everything gets enhanced.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, my dear friend, please note that all of these   recommendations are providing an additional hidden benefit: in order to   eagerly follow your advice, it may happen that some student gets   overslept and misses the exam... then you'll have one less paper to be   graded. No small mercy.<br>
