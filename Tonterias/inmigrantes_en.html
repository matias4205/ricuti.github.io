    <td height="645" valign="top" class="bodytext"><p><b><font color="#3F6386"><strong>Silly Things</strong><br>
              <span class="titulograndegris"><span title="Tonter&iacute;as"><strong>              The illiterate</strong></span></span> </font></b></p>
      <p><span title="Tonter&iacute;as">Historically,  European immigration made a powerful impact on Argentine society.  Contrary to popular belief, the largest waves of immigrants brought  only those who were just struggling to escape poverty and hunger (not a  totalitarian regime, though). The immediate, logical aftermath:  newcomers were those who had been expelled from the system, the  outcasts, the dispossessed, the illiterate, the uncouth guys.<br>
          <br>
          The man in the picture is Francisco Cabrera, my grandpa Pipo. In  1896, he arrived in Argentina in his elder brother's care. He had done  through fifth grade but once he was here he did not go on studying and  married my grandma, who at that time was 16.<br>
          <br>
          You'd say what a tough guy he must be, how can he be so uncaring as   to</span> have such memories of his  grandfather,   since deep down he is calling him an ignorant person.  Quite the contrary, as this silly thing is nothing but a small tribute  to that upright grocer (whom, by the way, I loved so much). Because my  grandad, as well as the hundreds of thousands of ignorant people that  were coming at the same time, were men of great wisdom despite the fact  that they were all men of little education.<span title="Tonter&iacute;as"> A love of art, respect for knowledge, admiration for science... drove  them to make their children study and get civilized... They could break  their own ass&nbsp;</span>slogging   their guts out for <span title="Tonter&iacute;as">a  book, or a notebook, or the white overall, or whatever their kids'  schooling required. And neither primary nor secondary education would  content them: </span><span title="Tonter&iacute;as">in an endeavor to have educated   children they would </span>encourage them to strive   for the highest college degree.<br>
          <span title="Tonter&iacute;as"><br>
          My  grandpa Pipo used to take my grandma out to the theater; my father and  my aunts studied music: they played the piano and also the violin. The  house had a large library where lots of books, paintings and sculptures  were kept. Thanks to my aunt Dora, who had a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, I  got bitten by the scientific curiosity bug.<br>
          <br>
          On raising this family, that ignorant Galician provided a good  model that should be followed by this tinellized, menemized,  maradonized Argentina of nowadays, so drowned in short-lived, coarse  values. I know</span> without a shadow of   a doubt that many of those immigrants,   although illiterate, were the greatest sages of Argentina.<br>
