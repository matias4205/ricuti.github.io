<p>  The kitchen is <em>the</em> place where people get mostly misled about the nature of clouds. While   everybody thinks they are actually composed of water vapor,   meteorologists come out to tell us it's not vapor but just liquid   water... very small drops of liquid water floating in the sky, that's to say, water held suspended in the atmosphere.<br>
  <br>
  How come liquid water is held suspended in the air? What about the   weight of water? Isn't liquid water expected to fall? Again,   meteorologists are good at enlightening us about that: although   water droplets forming clouds come in different sizes, their individual   weight will always be low enough for the wind force to drag them from   one place to another, either upwards, downwards, sidewards... blowing   the clouds any way or even making them keep still when it happens that   the wind takes them up as much as the Earth attracts them down. But when   their size and weight grow so large as to come down, then we have to   put up our umbrellas.<br>
  <br>
  Most physics teachers tend to  wholeheartedly endorse their argument saying that clouds could not be seen if they were just made up of water   vapor, as it is invisible. In fact, water vapor is actually a gas, a   dispersion of molecules of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) that run individually,   independently of each other and the rest, and totally incapable of   interacting with light rays. And yep, this combination as a whole is   transparent, as invisible as air. So those teachers are right.<br>
  <br>
  But the fact remains that their reasoning doesn't match the idea   that suddenly pops into our heads and makes us helplessly doubt their   gassy remarks: water vapor coming out of the kettle spout is visible! We're   all  keenly aware that a stream of that vapor would surely burn our   hands. The point is that teachers are not telling us that what we see   coming out of the spout is not vapor! They're not individual water   molecules but microdroplets of liquid water each consisting of hundreds   of millions of water molecules. Oh, really? Ciruela, you're driving me   nuts! Everyone knows full well that when water gets to its boiling point   it <span name="hotword">change</span>s <span name="hotword">from</span> <span name="hotword">a</span> <span name="hotword">liquid</span> <span name="hotword">to</span> <span name="hotword">a</span> <span name="hotword">gaseous</span> <span name="hotword">state. Huh! I'm gonna quit reading this one, dude.<br>
  <br>
  Let me explain myself a little more: it's true that at 100 &ordm;C (212   &ordm;F) liquid water turns into the gaseous form. It's the time when each   individual water molecule transits to a less associated state by gaining   an enormous amount of energy. But all of this happens inside the   kettle. Just after reaching the boiling point molecules start spurting   out of the kettle and immediately come up against the surrounding cool   air (cooler than the one in the pot). Right at that very moment they   condense into tiny water droplets (about 0.005 millimeters in diameter)   which lead to a visible mist. Mist is not gas, it's </span><span name="hotword">a   phenomenon caused by small droplets of liquid water suspended in air,   just as it happens in cloud formation. But as the stream flowing from   the spout keeps holding a very high temperature, then droplets evaporate   once again (just like they would at room temperature) and end up   becoming invisible at about one meter or so above the kettle spout.<br>
  <br>
  Only the first stage of the stream is water vapor (about 5   centimeters from the spout, at most; see image). What follows -and what   we all bear in mind- is just water suspended in air.<br>
  <br>
  Got it? Being so kettle-blind will not help you understand such a tricky universe.<br>
